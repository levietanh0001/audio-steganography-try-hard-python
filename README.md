## Project Explained
<p>To run this project, first double click on install-packages.bat to install required modules for the program. Then we run audio_steganography.bat to start the code.</p>
<p>The input wav file is located inside input folder, while the output wav file with encoded text could be found in output directory.</p>
<p>Inside audio_steganography.py we have 3 methods: encode, decode and start_steganography. We can adjust the path to input and output in start_steganography as shown below:</p>
